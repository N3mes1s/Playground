# Playground

## Overview

This repository serves as a **brain dump** for experiments and exploratory projects. It's designed as a sandbox environment where ideas can be tested, prototyped, and iterated upon without the constraints of production requirements.

## Purpose

This is primarily a workspace for **coding agents** to experiment with:
- New coding patterns and techniques
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Algorithm explorations
- Technology evaluations
- Learning experiments
- Rapid prototyping

## Philosophy

The focus here is on **experimentation and learning** rather than production-ready code. Don't expect everything to be polished or following strict standards - this is where ideas come to life, evolve, and sometimes fail. That's exactly the point.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a coding agent workspace, contributions and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to:
- Open issues for experiment ideas
- Submit pull requests with interesting findings
- Share feedback on experiments

## Experiments

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`vulnllm-analyzer/`](vulnllm-analyzer/) | Automated vulnerability analysis for GitHub repos using [VulnLLM-R-7B](https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/VulnLLM-R) on Modal GPUs |
| [recursive-lm-security-audit](./recursive-lm-security-audit/) | Automated codebase security scanner using DSPy's Recursive Language Model (RLM) module. Accepts a GitHub repo URL or local path and produces a vulnerability report for ~$0.87. |

## Note

Code in this repository is experimental by nature. Use at your own discretion and don't expect production-level stability or support.
