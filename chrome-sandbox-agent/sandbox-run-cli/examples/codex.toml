# sandbox-run config for OpenAI Codex CLI (native Rust binary, static-pie)
#
# Usage: sandbox-run --config codex.toml -- codex exec "prompt"
#
# Codex CLI is distributed via npm but the actual agent is a statically
# linked Rust binary. It bundles its own ripgrep (rg) for code search.
#
# Security: policy is always STRICT. This config only relaxes specific
# path filters and extensions — all 8 isolation layers remain active.

[sandbox]
# Network access required for OpenAI API calls

[paths]
# Codex binary and its bundled tools (read-only)
# /opt/node22 — npm shim invokes Node which spawns the native binary
# /etc/codex  — system-level managed config (requirements.toml etc.)

# Point CODEX_HOME to the real ~/.codex (mounted read-only above) so
